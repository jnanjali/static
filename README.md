The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, deploy a static website to AWS.

I have created an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secured it using IAM policies.

Next, i have uploaded the website files to the bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

Lastly, the website can be accessed your in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
